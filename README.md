# Javascript implementation of IFD parser #

Works with DNG and TIFF compatible formats. By now implementation is incomplete. It doesn't support files with little endian byte order, rational value type, multiple IFD.

No dependecies, only vanilla JS.

### Usage ###

Open index.html in your browser, drag and drop DNG file in browser window.
